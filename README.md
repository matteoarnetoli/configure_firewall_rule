I navigated to the _Firewall & network protection_ area within _Windows Security_ to make sure that the firewall configurations for _Domain Network_, _Private Network_ and _Public Network_ were active.</b>

Next, I wanted to allow a specific app to communicate on the Public Network. To do so, I needed to change the configuration from the _Allow an app through firewall_ area.

I found the app needed (Mozilla Firefox) and ticked the Public box next to its name. After this, users will be able to use the app on public network moving forward.
